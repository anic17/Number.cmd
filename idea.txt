Since it provides no advantages to store and calculate with binarys in batch,
I decided to use decimal numbers instead.

The rest is still the same, but structured more intuitive:

a_n...n_b_x...x

a : sign of whole number
n : significands
b : sign of exponent
x : exponent
_ : delimeter

a,b e {0;1}
0 : negative
1 : positive

the number of n's and x's is not predefined.
