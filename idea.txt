Since it provides no advantages to store and calculate with binarys in batch,
I decided to use decimal numbers instead.

The rest is still the same, but structured more intuitive:

a_n...n_b_x...x

a : sign of whole number
n : significands
b : sign of exponent
x : exponent
_ : delimeter

a,b e {0;1}
1 : negative
0 : positive

the number of n's and x's is not predefined.


Implementation:
  - The string will be saved in a .txt-file
  - The file will be located in %temp%
  - Its name will be the variable-name of the number
  - The string will be read with a for/f loop (delims=_)


Planned Functions:

    Arithmetic
        - addition
        - subtraction
        - multiplication
        - division
        - ...

    Variables
        - pi
        - e
        - ... (maybe some physical)

    Output & Input
        - Integer (decimal, binary, hexadecimal)
        - Double  (decimal)
        - Scientific (decimal)
        - text-file including the Number
